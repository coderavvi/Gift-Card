##Gift Card##

A gift card, in this context, refers to a system where certain assets are locked within a smart contract. At the same time the assets are locked, an NFT is minted in the same transaction. This NFT can then be transferred to anyone, and whoever holds it can later burn the NFT to release the locked assets. Essentially, the NFT serves as a tokenized gift card that grants access to the underlying assets.
