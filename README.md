What is a gift card?
In this context, a gift card will involve locking some assets in a smart contract. While some assets are being locked, we'll mint an NFT in the same transaction. This NFT could be sent anywhere and the owner of the NFT can burn it to unlock the assets that were previously locked. We can think of the NFT as a gift card.
